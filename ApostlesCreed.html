            the Father Almighty,<br>
            Creator of heaven and earth;<br>
            and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,<br>
            Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br>
            born of the Virgin Mary,<br>
            suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
            was crucified, died, and was buried.<br>
            He descended into hell,<br>
            on the third day He rose again from the dead.<br>
            He ascended into heaven,<br>
            and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;<br>
            from there He will come to judge the living and the dead.<br>

            I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>

            the communion of saints,<br>
            the forgiveness of sins,<br>
            the resurrection of the body,<br>
